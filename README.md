This is the client for a small project I did in March 2023 to learn about websockets, multiplayer game programming and data management in multithreaded Rust. This isn't really a game; you just have a cursor that the other players can see moving. Connect to the server by pressing `r`.
You can find the server for this project [in the Git repo](https://github.com/MaikoVDV/websocket-rust-server).
